# Tenx MCP Setup & Agent Rules Experimentation

This repository documents my work for the Tenx MCP setup challenge.

The goal of this project is to configure an IDE with the Tenx MCP Analysis server,
experiment with AI coding agent rules, and document how different configurations
affect agent behavior during real coding tasks.

## Objectives
- Configure and run the Tenx MCP Analysis server
- Connect the MCP server to a coding agent in my IDE
- Improve AI agent effectiveness using structured rules
- Observe and document agent behavior changes
- Reflect on insights gained from human–AI collaboration
